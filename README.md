# SECURE-FILE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-
# Secure File Management Process in Operating Systems (OS)

## Overview
This repository provides guidelines and best practices for securely managing files in an operating system environment. The process ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Features
- Secure file access control mechanisms
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure file transfer methods
- Regular auditing and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery plans

## File Access Control
Implement strict access control measures to restrict unauthorized file access:
1. Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define user permissions.
2. Apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP) for users and applications.
3. Set appropriate file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 sensitive_file.txt  # Read and write permissions for the owner only
   chmod 700 scripts/            # Full access for the owner, no access for others
   ```
4. Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) for finer permission control.
5. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical operations.

## Encryption for Secure Storage
1. Encrypt sensitive files using tools like **GnuPG**:
   ```bash
   gpg -c confidential.txt  # Encrypt a file
   gpg -d confidential.txt.gpg  # Decrypt a file
   ```
2. Use Full Disk Encryption (FDE) such as **LUKS** on Linux or **BitLocker** on Windows.
3. Securely store encryption keys in a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** or **Key Management System (KMS)**.

## Secure File Transfer
1. Use **SCP** or **SFTP** instead of insecure methods like FTP:
   ```bash
   scp confidential.txt user@remote-server:/path/to/destination/
   ```
2. Implement end-to-end encryption in file transfers using **TLS**.
3. Use **checksum verification** (SHA256, MD5) to ensure file integrity:
   ```bash
   sha256sum file.txt  # Generate hash
   ```

## Auditing & Monitoring
1. Enable file access logging using **auditd** on Linux:
   ```bash
   auditctl -w /path/to/sensitive_file -p rwxa -k sensitive_file_access
   ```
2. Regularly review system logs using **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tools.
3. Detect anomalies using **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** like **OSSEC** or **Snort**.

## Backup & Disaster Recovery
1. Implement **incremental backups** using tools like **rsync**:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --progress /source/ /backup/
   ```
2. Store backups securely with encryption and access control.
3. Regularly test backup restoration processes.
4. Use cloud-based backup solutions with multi-region support.

## Best Practices
- Keep the OS and file management tools updated with the latest security patches.
- Regularly audit user access and remove inactive accounts.
- Enable **Immutable Files** to prevent unauthorized modifications:
   ```bash
   chattr +i important_file.txt  # Make the file immutable
   ```
- Educate users about secure file management and phishing risks.
